## @mainpage SWAP Device Management Tool (GUI version)
# @section intro_sec Introduction
# SWAPdmt is management tool created to configure and monitor SWAP networks. This tool is entirely based on pyswap, our Python
# SWAP library. SWAPdmt can be used in different manners:
#
# - As a network sniffer: SWAPdmt lets you monitor wireless traffic in your SWAP network. This functionality is specially useful
# when developing new SWAP devices.
# - As an event monitor: SWAPdmt continuously listens the network and notifies the user about any new event occurred (new mote
# detected, endpoint value change, etc).
# - As a configuration tool for wireless motes. SWAPdmt can be used to change network addresses, frequency channels and any custom
# parameter related to any physical device in the network
#
# @section requi_sec Requirements
# SWAPdmt GUI needs at least Python 2.6 and wxPython 2.8 to work.
